  <summary> Notes </summary>
  <summary> Batch files are easy to mess with, so make sure that you have downloaded WinUtils from this repository. </summary>
  <summary> If you had to pay for this program, (if anyone would even sell batch files anyway) you just got SCAMMED. </summary>

# Install & Use
The entire software is just bunch of batch files. You just have to extract them before starting the application for best results. Run the `WinUtils.cmd` file.

Remember to delete "cached.dat" that the program created.

Thanks for using the software and thanks for trusting us.
